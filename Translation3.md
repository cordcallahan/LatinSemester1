C. Translation
Erechtheus was the son of Pandion who had four children. At the time, Eumolpus, the son of Neptune, came to Athens which had to be destroyed, but was defeated. Neptune was angry because his son was murdered by Erechtheus said “Erechtheus’ daughter needs to be sacrificed”. Therefore, his daughter ‘Chthonia’ was sacrificed. The remaining sisters killed themselves; Erechtheus was struck down by lightning.
