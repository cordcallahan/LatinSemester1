C. Translation

Long ago, Prometheus, first son of Iapetus, shaped man from mud. Minerva gave this woman a soul and all the gods sent gifts to her. Because of this, the name “Pandora” was given to her. Pandora was given by Jupiter away in marriage to Epimetheus. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
